What has preclinical systematic review ever done for us
=======

Abstract
-------

Systematic review and meta-analysis are a gift to the modern researcher, delivering a crystallized  
understanding of the existing research data in any given space. This can include whether candidate  
drugs are likely to work or not and which are better than others, whether our models of disease have  
predictive value and how this might be improved, and also how these all interact with disease pathophysiology. 

Grappling with the literature needed for such analyses is becoming increasingly difficult as the number of  
publications grows. However, narrowing the focus of a review to reduce workload runs the risk of diminishing  
the generalizability of conclusions drawn from such increasingly specific analyses.

Moreover, at the same time as we gain greater insight into our topic, we also discover more about the flaws that  
undermine much scientific research. Systematic review and meta-analysis have also shown that the quality of much  
preclinical research is inadequate. Systematic review has helped reveal the extent of selection bias, performance  
bias, detection bias, attrition bias, and low statistical power, raising questions about the validity of many  
preclinical research studies. This is perhaps the greatest virtue of systematic review and meta-analysis, the  
knowledge generated ultimately helps shed light on the limitations of existing research practice, and in doing so,  
helps bring reform and rigor to research across the sciences. 

In this commentary, we explore the lessons that we have identified through the lens of preclinical  
systematic review and meta-analysis.
